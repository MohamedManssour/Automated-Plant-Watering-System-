# Introduction for Automated Plant Watering System

This project utilizes Arduino and Java to create an automated plant watering system, providing an efficient and sustainable solution for plant care.

# Context
This project aims to provide a time-saving solution for plant care while maintaining optimal plant health. It serves as an excellent learning resource for beginners in coding and operating simple hardware.

# Technical Requirements
The system must detect dry soil conditions and automatically initiate watering, either through an Arduino or Java program. It should also include a manual override function for the water pump, and the capability to produce alerts through buzzer or LED. Additionally, it needs to graphically represent the soil moisture levels for real-time monitoring.

# Components
Laptop with installed Java program and javafx libraries
Arduino board
Additional components include Mosfet, moisture sensor, water pump, connectivity wires, 4AAA batteries, battery pack, water supply, and a plant for testing and growing.
Procedure
The setup procedure involves both hardware and software aspects.

Hardware Setup includes plant setup, assembling and connecting various hardware components, setting up the water reservoir, and connecting the system to the computer.

Software Setup involves preparing and running the Arduino code for the automated water system and Java code for user interactions (graphs and sliders).

# Test
Testing involved extensive hands-on experiments to ensure the reliable operation of the system. Multiple tests were performed under various conditions to simulate real-world usage and to rectify any issues that arose during development.

# Contingency
The project taught valuable lessons in time management and the importance of a dedicated workspace. These insights will significantly improve the workflow and results of future projects.

# Conclusion
This project provided invaluable experience in programming and applying knowledge to create a functioning system. The successful completion of this project lays a solid foundation for future learning and development.
